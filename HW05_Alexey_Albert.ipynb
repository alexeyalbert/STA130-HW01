    "CHAT SUMMARY (images used)\n",
    "In this conversation, you asked me to solve question 5 from an image about simulating a p-value using a 50/50 coin-flipping model. The problem involved testing the null hypothesis that humans have no preference for tilting their heads left or right when kissing, based on observed data where 80 out of 124 couples (64.5%) tilted their heads to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used Python with pandas and numpy to simulate the p-value by running 10,000 trials of head tilts under the null hypothesis. The resulting p-value was approximately 0.0013, which, according to the table provided, indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis. You mentioned getting a slightly different p-value (0.0021), and I explained that such variation is normal due to the randomness of the simulations.\n",

Even if the p-value is super low, it doesn't prove he's guilty—it just gives strong evidence.
